        <p>
          After a Master in Business from KEDGE BS (Bordeaux, France) and 4
          years in recruitment, mainly in the tech industry, I felt my learning
          curve was slowing down significantly. Eager to keep learning
          throughout my career, I found in web development a playground with
          infinite possibilities.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Newly graduated from Le Wagon, the #1 web development bootcamp in the
          world, I like to work in a challenging and creative environment to
          produce innovative tech solutions.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          From my previous jobs I have kept my excellent customer service,
          knowing how to work under pressure and tight deadlines and being a
          team player.
